# CPU SCHEDULING ALGORITHM
This project is a desktop-based Java Swing application that visually demonstrates CPU process scheduling algorithms.
It allows users to add processes with custom burst times and simulate different scheduling techniques like First Come First Serve (FCFS) and Round Robin (RR) with a specified time quantum.
